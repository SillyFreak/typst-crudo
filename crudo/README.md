# Crudo

Crudo allows conveniently working with `raw` blocks in terms of individual lines. It allows you to e.g.

- filter lines by content
- filter lines by range (slicing)
- transform lines
- join multiple raw blocks

While transforming the content, the original [parameters](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters) specified on the given raw block will be preserved.

See the [manual](docs/manual.pdf) for details.
